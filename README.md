# mealman
Meal manager for calorie counting. 

## What is this?
This is a simple tool I wrote for myself to help keep track of my meals and calories. 
Existing apps have too many features and are expensive if you want to use them practically. 
This simple tool has the minimum features that I need and just helps me automate the calorie counting and meal planning process. Its especially helpful for my homemade meals where there are few calorie labels.

## Features
- Meal plan files
- Custom list of calorie amounts per serving.
- Shows total calories consumed so far and calories remaining
